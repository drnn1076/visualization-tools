These are a series of small programs written in Processing to visualize historical data. They take as input XML files and output pdf files.

It locates a series of items on the timeline according the year given to each item, e.g. Item 1: year 1900; the program will locate the item 1 in the year 1900. Additional information can be added to each item and located along the timeline.
